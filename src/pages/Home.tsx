          These are my react projects. Some of them are based on interview
          questions I saw on youtube others are based on projects I saw
          elsewhere and thought I could build my own version of them. I also
          tried to add my own features and ideas whenever possible.

          None of these are particularly complicated, I just wanted to show that
          I understand the basics of react.
